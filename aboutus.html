		<h2>Courtney Kelley</h2>
		<p>My name is Courtney Kelley, I'm 17 and I'm going to be a senior in High School. I play lacrosse and really enjoy travelling.
      Spending time in the Kode with Klossy program  really opened my eyeys to the issues with the gender gap,
      so choosing to do Limitless as my final project was pretty much a no brainer</p>

		<h2>Layla Sheikh</h2>
		<p>Hi my name is Layla, I'm 13 years old and going into eighth grade. I really enjoy running and cross country and being outside in general. This summer is my first summer with Kode with Klossy and i am really interested in feminism because it is very interesting to me to see how different people view themselves as being a feminist and what the word means to them.</p>

  <div class="column"id="Sridula">
		<h2>Sridula Kunamneni</h2>
		<p>My name is Sridula and Iâ€™m going to be a sophomore in high school. I play volleyball and enjoy hiking. I am passionate about the topic of feminism because it is important that all genders are given equal opportunities and rights. The idea of showing multiple points of views of feminists seemed like a very interesting idea to me because it shows how not all feminists need to think the same way to still be a part of the movement.</p>
