      <p class="trial">Before women started petitioning or even thinking about gaining equal rights there were a lot of problems with the way people percieved women.
         Women didn't have the right to have control of income and didn't even have the right to keep their children after a divorce.
         Through the three waves of feminism things changed in massive ways.
         If the ladies of the 19th century didn't believe that they deseved to have rights our world would be in a much different place.

<h2 class="waves">The Second Wave</h2>
<p class="htext">• This wave started after women got the right to vote, and takes place after World War II</p>
<p class="htext">• Feminists participated in the civil rights movement, because they wanted more participation and equal pay in the workplace</p>

<p class="htext">• The Roe v. Wade case decision in Supreme Court was a huge milestone, because it gave women the right to an abortion. However, there are still states that are banning abortion</p>
